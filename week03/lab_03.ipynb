    "Data types are recognized.\n",
    "In supervised learning, the data must be properly labeled through human intervention.\n",
    "Supervised learning appears to be a long way from true artificial intelligence because of the notable quantity of human involvement.\n",
    "It is easy and reasonably priced.\n",

    "\n",
    "To teach the program how to mine the vast amount of unclassified data for insights. Unsupervised learning makes use of unclassified material. Since the model data is unlabeled and uncategorized, it is unclear how many classes there are. The algorithm now handles both the input and the output of data analysis due to unsupervised learning, with human involvement only needed for data validation. Unsupervised learning and artificial intelligence are very similar in that unsupervised learning requires less human involvement. It takes longer, is more difficult, and uses more resources. The training of the methods occurs in real time when using unsupervised learning. The accuracy of unsupervised learning is lower."
